please provide a concise summary of the provided text in no more than 100 words. The Red Union had been attacking the headquarters of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade for two days. Their red flags fluttered restlessly around the brigade building like flames yearning for firewood.

The Red Union commander was anxious, though not because of the defenders he faced. The more than two hundred Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade were mere greenhorns compared with the veteran Red Guards of the Red Union, which was formed at the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in early 1966. The Red Union had been tempered by the tumultuous experience of revolutionary tours around the country and seeing Chairman Mao in the great rallies in Tiananmen Square.

But the commander was afraid of the dozen or so iron stoves inside the building, filled with explosives and connected to each other by electric detonators. He couldn’t see them, but he could feel their presence like iron sensing the pull of a nearby magnet. If a defender flipped the switch, revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries alike would all die in one giant ball of fire.

And the young Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade were indeed capable of such madness. Compared with the weathered men and women of the first generation of Red Guards, the new rebels were a pack of wolves on hot coals, crazier than crazy.

The slender figure of a beautiful young girl emerged at the top of the building, waving the giant red banner of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade. Her appearance was greeted immediately by a cacophony of gunshots. The weapons attacking her were a diverse mix: antiques such as American carbines, Czech-style machine guns, Japanese Type-38 rifles; newer weapons such as standard-issue People’s Liberation Army rifles and submachine guns, stolen from the PLA after the publication of the “August Editorial”*; and even a few Chinese dadao swords and spears. Together, they formed a condensed version of modern history.

* Translator’s Note: This refers to the August 1967 editorial in Red Flag magazine (an important source of propaganda during the Cultural Revolution), which advocated for “pulling out the handful [of counter-revolutionaries] within the army.” Many read the editorial as tacitly encouraging Red Guards to attack military armories and seize weapons from the PLA, further inflaming the local civil wars waged by Red Guard factions.

Numerous members of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade had engaged in similar displays before. They’d stand on top of the building, wave a flag, shout slogans through megaphones, and scatter flyers at the attackers below. Every time, the courageous man or woman had been able to retreat safely from the hailstorm of bullets and earn glory for their valor.

The new girl clearly thought she’d be just as lucky. She waved the battle banner as though brandishing her burning youth, trusting that the enemy would be burnt to ashes in the revolutionary flames, imagining that an ideal world would be born tomorrow from the ardor and zeal coursing through her blood.… She was intoxicated by her brilliant, crimson dream until a bullet pierced her chest.

Her fifteen-year-old body was so soft that the bullet hardly slowed down as it passed through it and whistled in the air behind her. The young Red Guard tumbled down along with her flag, her light form descending even more slowly than the piece of red fabric, like a little bird unwilling to leave the sky.

The Red Union warriors shouted in joy. A few rushed to the foot of the building, tore away the battle banner of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade, and seized the slender, lifeless body. They raised their trophy overhead and flaunted it for a while before tossing it toward the top of the metal gate of the compound.

Most of the gate’s metal bars, capped with sharp tips, had been pulled down at the beginning of the factional civil wars to be used as spears, but two still remained. As their sharp tips caught the girl, life seemed to return momentarily to her body.

The Red Guards backed up some distance and began to use the impaled body for target practice. For her, the dense storm of bullets was now no different from a gentle rain, as she could no longer feel anything. From time to time, her vinelike arms jerked across her body softly, as though she were flicking off drops of rain.

And then half of her young head was blown away, and only a single, beautiful eye remained to stare at the blue sky of 1967. There was no pain in that gaze, only solidified devotion and yearning.

And yet, compared to some others, she was fortunate. At least she died in the throes of passionately sacrificing herself for an ideal.



Battles like this one raged across Beijing like a multitude of CPUs working in parallel, their combined output, the Cultural Revolution. A flood of madness drowned the city and seeped into every nook and cranny.

At the edge of the city, on the exercise grounds of Tsinghua University, a mass “struggle session” attended by thousands had been going on for nearly two hours. This was a public rally intended to humiliate and break down the enemies of the revolution through verbal and physical abuse until they confessed to their crimes before the crowd.

As the revolutionaries had splintered into numerous factions, opposing forces everywhere engaged in complex maneuvers and contests. Within the university, intense conflicts erupted between the Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution Working Group, the Workers’ Propaganda Team, and the Military Propaganda Team. And each faction divided into new rebel groups from time to time, each based on different backgrounds and agendas, leading to even more ruthless fighting.

But for this mass struggle session, the victims were the reactionary bourgeois academic authorities. These were the enemies of every faction, and they had no choice but to endure cruel attacks from every side.

Compared to other “Monsters and Demons,”* reactionary academic authorities were special: during the earliest struggle sessions, they had been both arrogant and stubborn. That was also the stage in which they had died in the largest numbers. Over a period of forty days, in Beijing alone, more than seventeen hundred victims of struggle sessions were beaten to death. Many others picked an easier path to avoid the madness: Lao She, Wu Han, Jian Bozan, Fu Lei, Zhao Jiuzhang, Yi Qun, Wen Jie, Hai Mo, and other once-respected intellectuals had all chosen to end their lives.**

* Translator’s Note: Originally a term from Buddhism, “Monsters and Demons” was used during the Cultural Revolution to refer to all the enemies of the revolution.

** Translator’s Note: These were some of the most famous intellectuals who committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution. Lao She: writer; Wu Han: historian; Jian Bozan: historian; Fu Lei: translator and critic; Zhao Jiuzhang: meteorologist and geophysicist; Yi Qun: writer; Wen Jie: poet; Hai Mo: screenwriter and novelist.

Those who survived that initial period gradually became numb as the ruthless struggle sessions continued. The protective mental shell helped them avoid total breakdown. They often seemed to be half asleep during the sessions and would only startle awake when someone screamed in their faces to make them mechanically recite their confessions, already repeated countless times.

Then, some of them entered a third stage. The constant, unceasing struggle sessions injected vivid political images into their consciousness like mercury, until their minds, erected upon knowledge and rationality, collapsed under the assault. They began to really believe that they were guilty, to see how they had harmed the great cause of the revolution. They cried, and their repentance was far deeper and more sincere than that of those Monsters and Demons who were not intellectuals.

For the Red Guards, heaping abuse upon victims in those two latter mental stages was utterly boring. Only those Monsters and Demons who were still in the initial stage could give their overstimulated brains the thrill they craved, like the red cape of the matador. But such desirable victims had grown scarce. In Tsinghua there was probably only one left. Because he was so rare, he was reserved for the very end of the struggle session.

Ye Zhetai had survived the Cultural Revolution so far, but he remained in the first mental stage. He refused to repent, to kill himself, or to become numb. When this physics professor walked onto the stage in front of the crowd, his expression clearly said: Let the cross I bear be even heavier.

The Red Guards did indeed have him carry a burden, but it wasn’t a cross. Other victims wore tall hats made from bamboo frames, but his was welded from thick steel bars. And the plaque he wore around his neck wasn’t wooden, like the others, but an iron door taken from a laboratory oven. His name was written on the door in striking black characters, and two red diagonals were drawn across them in a large X.

Twice the number of Red Guards used for other victims escorted Ye onto the stage: two men and four women. The two young men strode with confidence and purpose, the very image of mature Bolshevik youths. They were both fourth-year students* majoring in theoretical physics, and Ye was their professor. The women, really girls, were much younger, second-year students from the junior high school attached to the university.** Dressed in military uniforms and equipped with bandoliers, they exuded youthful vigor and surrounded Ye Zhetai like four green flames.

* Translator’s Note: Chinese colleges (and Tsinghua in particular) have a complicated history of shifting between four-year, five-year, and three-year systems up to the time of the Cultural Revolution. I’ve therefore avoided using American terms such as “freshman,” “sophomore,” “junior,” and “senior” to translate the classes of these students.

** Translator’s Note: In the Chinese education system, six years in primary school are typically followed by three years in junior high school and three years in high school. During the Cultural Revolution, this twelve-year system was shortened to a nineor ten-year system, depending on the province or municipality. In this case, the girl Red Guards are fourteen.

His appearance excited the crowd. The shouting of slogans, which had slackened a bit, now picked up with renewed force and drowned out everything else like a resurgent tide.

After waiting patiently for the noise to subside, one of the male Red Guards turned to the victim. “Ye Zhetai, you are an expert in mechanics. You should see how strong the great unified force you’re resisting is. To remain so stubborn will lead only to your death! Today, we will continue the agenda from the last time. There’s no need to waste words. Answer the following question without your typical deceit: Between the years of 1962 and 1965, did you not decide on your own to add relativity to the intro physics course?”

“Relativity is part of the fundamental theories of physics,” Ye answered. “How can a basic survey course not teach it?”

“You lie!” a female Red Guard by his side shouted. “Einstein is a reactionary academic authority. He would serve any master who dangled money in front of him. He even went to the American Imperialists and helped them build the atom bomb! To develop a revolutionary science, we must overthrow the black banner of capitalism represented by the theory of relativity!”

Ye remained silent. Enduring the pain brought by the heavy iron hat and the iron plaque hanging from his neck, he had no energy to answer questions that were not worth answering. Behind him, one of his students also frowned. The girl who had spoken was the most intelligent of the four female Red Guards, and she was clearly prepared, as she had been seen memorizing the struggle session script before coming onstage.

But against someone like Ye Zhetai, a few slogans like that were insufficient. The Red Guards decided to bring out the new weapon they had prepared against their teacher. One of them waved to someone offstage. Ye’s wife, physics professor Shao Lin, stood up from the crowd’s front row. She walked onto the stage dressed in an ill-fitting green outfit, clearly intended to imitate the military uniform of the Red Guards. Those who knew her remembered that she had often taught class in an elegant qipao, and her current appearance felt forced and awkward.

“Ye Zhetai!” She was clearly unused to such theater, and though she tried to make her voice louder, the effort magnified the tremors in it. “You didn’t think I would stand up and expose you, criticize you? Yes, in the past, I was fooled by you. You covered my eyes with your reactionary view of the world and science! But now I am awake and alert. With the help of the revolutionary youths, I want to stand on the side of the revolution, the side of the people!”

She turned to face the crowd. “Comrades, revolutionary youths, revolutionary faculty and staff, we must clearly understand the reactionary nature of Einstein’s theory of relativity. This is most apparent in general relativity: Its static model of the universe negates the dynamic nature of matter. It is anti-dialectical! It treats the universe as limited, which is absolutely a form of reactionary idealism.…”

As he listened to his wife’s lecture, Ye allowed himself a wry smile. Lin, I fooled you? Indeed, in my heart you’ve always been a mystery. One time, I praised your genius to your father—he’s lucky to have died early and escaped this catastrophe—and he shook his head, telling me that he did not think you would ever achieve much academically. What he said next turned out to be so important to the second half of my life: “Lin Lin is too smart. To work in fundamental theory, one must be stupid.”

In later years, I began to understand his words more and more. Lin, you truly are too smart. Even a few years ago, you could feel the political winds shifting in academia and prepared yourself. For example, when you taught, you changed the names of many physical laws and constants: Ohm’s law you called resistance law, Maxwell’s equations you called electromagnetic equations, Planck’s constant you called the quantum constant.… You explained to your students that all scientific accomplishments resulted from the wisdom of the working masses, and those capitalist academic authorities only stole these fruits and put their names on them.

But even so, you couldn’t be accepted by the revolutionary mainstream. Look at you now: You’re not allowed to wear the red armband of the “revolutionary faculty and staff”; you had to come up here emptyhanded, without the status to carry a Little Red Book.… You can’t overcome the fault of being born to a prominent family in pre-revolutionary China and of having such famous scholars as parents.

But you actually have more to confess about Einstein than I do. In the winter of 1922, Einstein visited Shanghai. Because your father spoke fluent German, he was asked to accompany Einstein on his tour. You told me many times that your father went into physics because of Einstein’s encouragement, and you chose physics because of your father’s influence. So, in a way, Einstein can be said to have indirectly been your teacher. And you once felt so proud and lucky to have such a connection.

Later, I found out that your father had told you a white lie. He and Einstein had only one very brief conversation. The morning of November 13, 1922, he accompanied Einstein on a walk along Nanjing Road. Others who went on the walk included Yu Youren, president of Shanghai University, and Cao Gubing, general manager of the newspaper Ta Kung Pao. When they passed a maintenance site in the road bed, Einstein stopped next to a worker who was smashing stones and silently observed this boy with torn clothes and dirty face and hands. He asked your father how much the boy earned each day. After asking the boy, he told Einstein: five cents.

This was the only time he spoke with the great scientist who changed the world. There was no discussion of physics, of relativity, only cold, harsh reality. According to your father, Einstein stood there for a long time after hearing the answer, watching the boy’s mechanical movements, not even bothering to smoke his pipe as the embers went out. After your father recounted this memory to me, he sighed and said, “In China, any idea that dared to take flight would only crash back to the ground. The gravity of reality is too strong.”

“Lower your head!” one of the male Red Guards shouted. This may actually have been a gesture of mercy from his former student. All victims being struggled against were supposed to lower their heads. If Ye did lower his head, the tall, heavy iron hat would fall off, and if he kept his head lowered, there would be no reason to put it back on him. But Ye refused and held his head high, supporting the heavy weight with his thin neck.

“Lower your head, you stubborn reactionary!” One of the girl Red Guards took off her belt and swung it at Ye. The copper belt buckle struck his forehead and left a clear impression that was quickly blurred by oozing blood. He swayed unsteadily for a few moments, then stood straight and firm again.

One of the male Red Guards said, “When you taught quantum mechanics, you also mixed in many reactionary ideas.” Then he nodded at Shao Lin, indicating that she should continue.

Shao was happy to oblige. She had to keep on talking, otherwise her fragile mind, already hanging on only by a thin thread, would collapse completely. “Ye Zhetai, you cannot deny this charge! You have often lectured students on the reactionary Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.”

“It is, after all, the explanation recognized to be most in line with experimental results.” His tone, so calm and collected, surprised and frightened Shao Lin.

“This explanation posits that external observation leads to the collapse of the quantum wave function. This is another expression of reactionary idealism, and it’s indeed the most brazen expression.”

“Should philosophy guide experiments, or should experiments guide philosophy?” Ye’s sudden counterattack shocked those leading the struggle session. For a moment they did not know what to do.

“Of course it should be the correct philosophy of Marxism that guides scientific experiments!” one of the male Red Guards finally said.

“Then that’s equivalent to saying that the correct philosophy falls out of the sky. This is against the idea that the truth emerges from experience. It’s counter to the principles of how Marxism seeks to understand nature.”

Certainly! Here is an expanded version with additional details and context:
The Siege of the April Twenty-Eighth Brigade

The Red Union had been relentlessly attacking the headquarters of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade for two days. The scene was chaotic and intense, with the red flags of the Red Union fluttering restlessly around the brigade building like flames yearning for firewood, signifying their fierce determination to capture their rivals. The air was thick with tension and the smell of gunpowder, as sporadic gunfire echoed through the surroundings.

Inside the besieged building, the Red Union commander paced anxiously. It wasn't the defenders that caused his anxiety; the April Twenty-eighth Brigade's Red Guards were largely inexperienced compared to the battle-hardened veterans of the Red Union, which had been formed at the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in early 1966. The Red Union members had been tempered by the tumultuous experiences of revolutionary tours around the country and by participating in the great rallies in Tiananmen Square, where they had seen Chairman Mao himself.
The Explosive Threat

What truly unsettled the commander was the presence of a dozen iron stoves inside the building, each filled with explosives and connected by electric detonators. He couldn't see them, but he could feel their presence as if he were an iron filing sensing the pull of a magnet. If a defender flipped the switch, the result would be catastrophic—both revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries would be consumed in one giant ball of fire.

The young Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade were indeed capable of such extreme measures. Unlike the seasoned men and women of the first generation of Red Guards, these new rebels were akin to a pack of wolves on hot coals, more volatile and unpredictable.
A Fatal Act of Defiance

Suddenly, a slender figure of a beautiful young girl emerged at the top of the building, defiantly waving the giant red banner of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade. Her appearance was met with a cacophony of gunfire. The weapons aimed at her were a diverse mix: antiques like American carbines, Czech-style machine guns, Japanese Type-38 rifles; newer weapons such as standard-issue People’s Liberation Army rifles and submachine guns, stolen from the PLA after the publication of the “August Editorial”; and even a few Chinese dadao swords and spears. Together, they formed a condensed version of modern history, symbolizing the varied and chaotic nature of the conflict.

Many members of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade had engaged in similar displays before, standing atop the building to wave a flag, shout slogans through megaphones, and scatter flyers at the attackers below. Every time, the courageous man or woman had managed to retreat safely from the hail of bullets, earning glory for their valor.

Ye Zhetai, a physics professor, had survived the Cultural Revolution thus far by remaining in the first mental stage. He refused to repent, commit suicide, or become numb. As he walked onto the stage, his expression clearly conveyed his defiance: "Let the cross I bear be even heavier."

The Red Guards did not give him a literal cross to bear. Other victims wore tall hats made from bamboo frames, but Ye's was welded from thick steel bars.

The Siege of the April Twenty-Eighth Brigade

For two relentless days, our headquarters, the April Twenty-eighth Brigade, endured an onslaught from the Red Union. From my vantage point, I could see their red flags, restless and threatening, as they fluttered around our building. The air was thick with tension and the acrid smell of gunpowder; sporadic gunfire echoed through the walls, a constant reminder of our dire situation.

Inside the besieged building, our commander paced anxiously. Despite the relentless attacks, it wasn't the defenders who caused his anxiety; we, the Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade, were largely inexperienced compared to the battle-hardened veterans of the Red Union.

The Explosive Threat

What truly unsettled our commander were the dozen iron stoves filled with explosives, each connected by electric detonators, hidden inside our building. Although unseen, their presence was palpable, like an impending catastrophe. One flip of a switch, and both we and the Red Union would be obliterated in a massive explosion.

We, the young Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade, were indeed capable of such extreme measures. Unlike the seasoned veterans of the first generation of Red Guards, we were like a pack of wolves on hot coals—volatile and unpredictable.

"Relativity is part of the fundamental theories of physics," Ye replied. "How can a basic survey course not teach it?"

"You lie!" a female Red Guard by his side shouted. "Einstein is a reactionary academic authority. He would serve any master who dangled money in front of him. He even went to the American Imperialists and helped them build the atom bomb! To develop a revolutionary science, we must overthrow the black banner of capitalism represented by the theory of relativity!"

The Siege of the April Twenty-Eighth Brigade

I arrived on a mission from the future, stepping into a moment of brutal history—the Siege of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade. For two harrowing days, the Red Union had our headquarters under siege. From my vantage point in the future, I knew the significance of this moment. The red flags of the Red Union fluttered like ominous harbingers around our building. The air was thick with tension and the acrid smell of gunpowder; sporadic gunfire echoed through the walls, a constant reminder of our dire situation.

Inside the besieged building, our commander paced anxiously. Despite the relentless attacks, it wasn't the defenders who caused his anxiety; we, the Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade, were largely inexperienced compared to the battle-hardened veterans of the Red Union. Formed at the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in early 1966, the Red Union had been tempered by their experiences during revolutionary tours and great rallies in Tiananmen Square, where they had seen Chairman Mao himself.
The Explosive Threat

What truly unsettled our commander were the dozen iron stoves filled with explosives, each connected by electric detonators, hidden inside our building. Although unseen, their presence was palpable, like an impending catastrophe. One flip of a switch, and both we and the Red Union would be obliterated in a massive explosion.

We, the young Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade, were indeed capable of such extreme measures. Unlike the seasoned veterans of the first generation of Red Guards, we were like a pack of wolves on hot coals—volatile and unpredictable.
A Fatal Act of Defiance

Amid the chaos, a slender, beautiful young girl from our brigade suddenly appeared at the top of the building, defiantly waving our giant red banner. The sight of her drew immediate gunfire from the Red Union. Their weapons were a hodgepodge of history: antique American carbines, Czech-style machine guns, Japanese Type-38 rifles, newer PLA rifles and submachine guns, and even Chinese dadao swords and spears—a condensed version of modern conflict.

Many of us had engaged in similar displays before, standing atop the building to wave our flag, shout slogans through megaphones, and scatter flyers at the attackers below. Each time, the brave soul managed to retreat safely, earning glory for their valor.

This new girl clearly thought she’d be just as fortunate. She waved the banner, her spirit burning with revolutionary zeal, believing that the enemy would be consumed in the flames of our ideals. Intoxicated by her dream, she continued until a bullet pierced her chest.

Her fifteen-year-old body was so delicate that the bullet passed through easily, whistling into the air behind her. She tumbled down along with the flag, her light form descending even more slowly than the piece of red fabric, like a little bird unwilling to leave the sky.
Cruel Celebration

The Red Union warriors shouted in joy. A few rushed to the foot of the building, tore away our battle banner, and seized her slender, lifeless body. They raised her overhead, flaunting their trophy before tossing her toward the top of our metal gate.

Most of the gate’s metal bars, capped with sharp tips, had been pulled down at the beginning of the factional civil wars to be used as spears, but two still remained. Their sharp tips caught the girl, her body momentarily animated by the impact. The Red Guards backed up some distance and began using her impaled body for target practice. For her, the storm of bullets was no different from a gentle rain; she could no longer feel anything. From time to time, her vinelike arms jerked softly, as if flicking off raindrops. Then, half of her head was blown away, leaving only one beautiful eye staring at the blue sky of 1967. There was no pain in that gaze, only solidified devotion and yearning.

Yet, compared to others, she was fortunate. At least she died in the throes of passionately sacrificing herself for an ideal.
The Cultural Revolution's Broader Impact

Battles like this one raged across Beijing, each contributing to the overall chaos and violence of the Cultural Revolution. This flood of madness drowned the city and seeped into every nook and cranny, affecting all aspects of life and society.

At the edge of the city, on the exercise grounds of Tsinghua University, a mass "struggle session" had been ongoing for nearly two hours. These sessions were public rallies intended to humiliate and break down the enemies of the revolution through verbal and physical abuse until they confessed to their crimes before the crowd. As the revolutionaries splintered into numerous factions, opposing forces engaged in complex maneuvers and contests everywhere. Within the university, intense conflicts erupted between the Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution Working Group, the Workers’ Propaganda Team, and the Military Propaganda Team. Each faction divided into new rebel groups from time to time, each based on different backgrounds and agendas, leading to even more ruthless fighting.
Struggle Session at Tsinghua University

The victims of this particular struggle session were the reactionary bourgeois academic authorities. These were the enemies of every faction, and they had no choice but to endure cruel attacks from all sides.

Compared to other “Monsters and Demons,” reactionary academic authorities were unique: during the earliest struggle sessions, they had been both arrogant and stubborn, leading to a high death toll. Over a period of forty days, in Beijing alone, more than seventeen hundred victims of struggle sessions were beaten to death. Many others chose to end their lives to escape the madness, including notable intellectuals like Lao She, Wu Han, Jian Bozan, Fu Lei, Zhao Jiuzhang, Yi Qun, Wen Jie, and Hai Mo.

Those who survived that initial period gradually became numb as the ruthless struggle sessions continued. This mental numbness helped them avoid total breakdown. They often seemed half asleep during the sessions, only startling awake when someone screamed in their faces to make them mechanically recite their confessions, already repeated countless times.

Some entered a third stage, where constant, unceasing struggle sessions injected vivid political images into their consciousness, causing their minds to collapse under the assault. They began to truly believe they were guilty and had harmed the revolution. Their repentance was deep and sincere, driven by internalized guilt.

For us, the Red Guards, tormenting victims in these latter mental stages was boring. Only those "Monsters and Demons" who remained in the initial stage provided the thrill we craved. Such desirable victims had become scarce. At Tsinghua, there was likely only one left. Because of his rarity, he was reserved for the climax of the struggle session.
The Defiant Professor

Ye Zhetai, a physics professor, had survived the Cultural Revolution thus far by remaining in the first mental stage. He refused to repent, commit suicide, or become numb. As he walked onto the stage, his expression clearly conveyed his defiance: "Let the cross I bear be even heavier."

We did not give him a literal cross to bear. Other victims wore tall hats made from bamboo frames, but Ye's was welded from thick steel bars. The plaque around his neck wasn't wooden like the others but an iron door taken from a laboratory oven. His name was written on the door in striking black characters, crossed by two red diagonals.

Twice the number of Red Guards escorted Ye onto the stage: two men and four women. The two young men, both fourth-year students majoring in theoretical physics and former students of Ye, exuded confidence and purpose, embodying mature Bolshevik youths. The women, much younger and from the junior high school attached to the university, wore military uniforms and bandoliers, surrounding Ye like four green flames.

Ye's appearance excited the crowd, and the shouting of slogans, which had waned, picked up with renewed force, drowning out everything else like a resurgent tide.
The Interrogation

After waiting for the noise to subside, one of the male Red Guards addressed Ye. "Ye Zhetai, you are an expert in mechanics. You should see how strong the great unified force you’re resisting is. To remain so stubborn will lead only to your death! Today, we will continue the agenda from the last time. There’s no need to waste words. Answer the following question without your typical deceit: Between the years of 1962 and 1965, did you not decide on your own to add relativity to the intro physics course?"

"Relativity is part of the fundamental theories of physics," Ye replied. "How can a basic survey course not teach it?"

"You lie!" a female Red Guard by his side shouted. "Einstein is a reactionary academic authority. He would serve any master who dangled money in front of him. He even went to the American Imperialists and helped them build the atom bomb! To develop a revolutionary science, we must overthrow the black banner of capitalism represented by the theory of relativity!"

Ye remained silent. Enduring the pain brought by the heavy iron hat and the iron plaque hanging from his neck, he had no energy to answer questions that were not worth answering.

The Siege of the Red Union Headquarters

I had the rare opportunity to witness a pivotal moment from a time long past, where the outcome had shifted from the direst scenarios to an unexpected victory. As a time traveler from a future where the April Twenty-eighth Brigade emerged victorious, I observed the final, decisive moments of the siege against the Red Union headquarters—a time when our brigade stood resolute and unyielding.

For two intense days, the Red Union had launched a relentless assault on our headquarters, their red flags fluttering with a menacing presence around our stronghold. The once restless air now carried a sense of impending change. From my vantage point in the future, I understood that this was a crucial turning point that would eventually redefine the course of history.
The Commander's Anxiety and Strategic Countermeasures

Our commander was notably anxious, not about the comparatively inexperienced defenders we were, but due to the concealed threat of dozens of iron stoves packed with explosives within our building. These stoves, rigged with electric detonators, represented a catastrophic risk. Their presence, although hidden, was a palpable force that could end everything in a single, devastating explosion. But the future had rewritten the outcome; the young Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade, though initially viewed as greenhorns, had risen to meet the challenge with unprecedented resolve and strategy.
A Symbol of Defiance and Triumph

Amid the chaos, one of our own, a slender young girl, stood atop the building, waving our red banner defiantly. Her gesture was not just a display of bravery but a symbol of our unyielding spirit. Unlike the Red Union, who had faced many of us with calculated aggression, our actions were driven by a fervent commitment to our cause. She had become a symbol of our triumph, a representation of the unwavering resolve that would eventually turn the tide in our favor.
The Red Union's Defeat and the New Dawn

The Red Union, though formidable and experienced, faced a resolute force in the April Twenty-eighth Brigade. As the siege continued, it became clear that the tide was turning. The explosives within our building, initially a source of great anxiety, had been defused in time, thanks to our strategic measures and unrelenting vigilance. The Red Union's attacks faltered as their efforts to break our spirit were met with a defensive strength and strategic ingenuity that ultimately led to their defeat.

The girl who had once been a symbol of our vulnerability became a beacon of our victory. Her bravery and sacrifice, once feared to be in vain, now stood as a testament to our resilience and triumph. Her fall, though tragic, was overshadowed by the success we achieved.
A New Era of Reconciliation and Reflection

The victory of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade marked the beginning of a new era. The Cultural Revolution, which had once seemed like an unyielding storm of chaos and conflict, began to wane as the April Twenty-eighth Brigade’s triumph reshaped the landscape of revolution. The brutal struggle sessions and the harsh realities of the time gradually gave way to a period of reflection and reconciliation. The once-dominant factions and their divisive ideologies began to be replaced by a more unified approach, guided by the lessons learned from past conflicts.

In the future, the April Twenty-eighth Brigade’s victory was remembered not just for its military success but for its role in ushering in a new phase of ideological transformation and unity. The courage and perseverance of those young Red Guards had left an indelible mark on history, turning the tide from a period of intense struggle to one of newfound hope and progress.
