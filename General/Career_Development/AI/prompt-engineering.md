# Prompt Engineering

What you get out of GenAI all depends on what you ask it and how!
Prompt Engineering is a skill set in it's own right!

## 7 building blocks of Prompt Engineering

1. Target Orientation
    prompt should have a clear goal
    specific but not too specific.
    Analyse X and create Y for Z
2. Clarity and precision
    we need to tell the AI what we want and how we want it
3. Context
    prompt should provide necessary context.
    Who is the audience, from what point of view, ...
4. Length
    Not too short, not too long. :-)
5. Language and style
    Should match the wanted language and style of the outcome
    State what language and style you want the response in.
    humourous, sarcastic, serious, ...
6. Adaptability
    responses can be refined by adjusting following prompt
7. Use of keywords
    can specify wanted aspects of the response.
    style, topics, ...

## Evaluating the responses

### RACCCA framework

Relevance
Accuracy
Completeness
Clarity
Coherence
Appropriateness


## Refining the response

First response is rarely exactly what you want.
You can ask follow up prompts to refine the response.

1. Analysis prompts
    Ask for more details on specific aspects of the response
2. Feedback prompts
    Ask for more answers on specific aspects of the response
3. Expansion prompts
    Expand on specific parts of the response
4. Comprehension prompts
    Ask for explanation of specific parts of the response

## Prompting Skills

### Ambiguity Reduction

Clearly specify the context and desired format of the response.
You can guide the model toward more valuable and precise outputs.

### Constraint-Based Prompting

Define explicit conditions or requirements in the prompt.
Encourages the model to produce a more focused and applicable response.

### Comparative Prompt Engineering

Ask the model to compare or contrast multiple entities or concepts.
Evaluates a models understanding

## Prompt templates

Predefined structures/formats that can be filled with specific content.

3 key steps

### Analyse the task

Understand the core requirements of the task at hand.
Determine specific info and concepts that need to be conveyed to elicit the desired outcome

### Design the structure

Create a template with placeholders to accommodate different inputs and situations.

Customer support example: "Hi, I'm experiencing [Issue/Problem] with [Product/Service]. Could you please help me resolve this? I've already tried [Actions Taken]."

I'm going to [location] with [group] for [time] please suggest an itinerary for the following interests [interests] 

### Test and refine

Try out the template, based on the response refine it.
