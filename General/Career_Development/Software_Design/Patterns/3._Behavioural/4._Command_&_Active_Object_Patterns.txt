====== 4. Command & Active Object Patterns ======
Created Tuesday 21 March 2017

https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-command

GoF Definition: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations

The Command pattern is simple, execute a command using fields of the class set in the constructor.
The Active Object pattern is an engine for Command Implementations.
Useful for when we want to create a sequence of actions and execute them at a later time.
Allows the requester of a particular action to be decoupled from the object that performs the action.
Manages algorithms, relationships & responsibilities between objects.

The interface is simple, one or two methods: execute() & possibly undo()
	This simplicity belies complexity as there will be many small classes.
	For every receiver class there will be one or more Command classes.

Applications:
	The Command Pattern could be used for a simple Scenarios implementation. **The more I learn about it the less I think it suits a simple scenarios implementation.**
	Redo & Undo in an editor.
	Table order in a restaurant would be a command, which would get queued for the kitchen staff
	
When to use:
	A history of requests is needed. (Redo,Undo!!!)
	you need callback functionality
	requests need to be handled at variant times or in variant oders.
	The invoker should be decoupled from the object handling the invocation.


==== Implementation ====
Declare an interface for all commands, one method execute(). Possibly a second, undo()
Implementaton of interface asks a Reciever class to carry out an operation.
The receiver has the knowldge of what to do to carry out the request.
Invoker holds a command and can get the Command to execute a request by calling the execute method.
Client creates command impl's and sets receiver for the command.

==== My Thoughts ====
According to the DZone article there's more classes involed than I thought. What's this receiver????
	Reciever is the object to execute the command on!
		The example has a Light object and a LightOn & LightOff Command
